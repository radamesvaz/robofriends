# RoboFriends

## Development
This app was developed using React and Redux. This was my first project using both technologies, I like the concept of React, having individual components that can be implemented in different parts of the app, and Redux as a state manager makes everything more organized, I can see why big projects use Redux to manage their app's state.

The image of robots are fetched from the RoboHash API. Having an object with the users information, I asign a new user to the fetch request so it has a Robot for picture. I'm currently working on adding a backend to the application so I won't have my users as an object, therefore adding some more interactivity, so each new user can create their own Robot with their information.

## How To Use

The main point of the app is to filter robots according to the user's input in the Searchbox. Just type in the SearchRobots and the application will show robots that match the criteria of your search.

You can also scroll down and see every robot.
