# RoboFriends

## Development
This app was developed using React and Redux. This was my first project using both technologies, I like the concept of React, having individual components that can be implemented in different parts of the app, and Redux as a state manager makes everything more organized, I can see why big projects use Redux to manage their app's state.

The image of robots are fetched from the RoboHash API. Having an object with the users information, I asign a new user to the fetch request so it has a Robot for picture. I'm currently working on adding a backend to the application so I won't have my users as an object, therefore adding some more interactivity, so each new user can create their own Robot with their information.
